## Spec Omissions

Fetch is a browser API, but this library is written in Node.js. We try to be as spec compliant as possible; however, some aspects just cannot be recreated on the server. **All Fetch WHATWG Spec omissions are detailed here**. Each part should have a summary of the omission, plus links to relevant spec section and additional documentation.
